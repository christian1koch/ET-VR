# VR Hand Gestures Spellcasting Prototype (Meta Quest 3) 👋 🔮

## Overview
This project is an experimental **VR hand gstures spellcasting prototype** built in **Unity 2023 LTS** for **Meta Quest 3**.  
Players use **hand gestures (no controllers)** to cast elemental spells, defend, and move around a combat arena.

For the initial **Proof of Concept (PoC)**, the focus is on:
- Reliable **hand tracking and gesture recognition**  
- Casting and visualizing **3–5 core spells**  
- Lightweight **arena-based PvE** testing (dummy targets)  
- Minimal visuals and feedback for performance validation
